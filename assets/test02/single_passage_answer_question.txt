1,What do the giants look like?,"One giant is burly, grey-skinned, and 20 feet tall. It wears heavy dark iron armour covered in metal torns. It is leaning against a chamber wall, carrying what looks to be two tower shields nearly as tall as itself, both bearing

- Information is taken from an unstructured text file.
- It must be able to tell me if it doesnâ€™t know the answer to my question.
- Fast.
- Efficient enough to run on my MacBook with other programs without any performance issues.
- Locally run for privacy and to ensure it will always be free, runnable, and consistent."

6,What kinds of models would need to be officially registered?,"High-risk AI systems that are deployed by public authorities or entities acting on their behalf will have to be registered in a public EU database, unless those systems are used for law enforcement and migration.

6,"What kinds of AI carry ""systematic risks""?","For now, general purpose AI models that were trained using a total computing power of more than 10^25 FLOPs are considered to carry systemic risks, given that models trained with larger compute tend to be more powerful. The AI Office (established within the Commission) may update this threshold in light of technological advances, and may furthermore in specific cases designate other models as such based on further criteria (e.g. number of users, or the degree of autonomy of the model)."
